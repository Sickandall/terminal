#Multilingual Compiler for Code in Native and Programming Languages
Overview
This project is a unique Multilingual Compiler designed to break down language barriers in coding by allowing developers to write code using their native languages (like Hindi, Punjabi, and English) and popular programming languages. The compiler translates code written in natural language into any supported programming language, making it accessible for beginners and experienced developers alike. Whether youâ€™re coding in Python, Java, or C, or writing logic in your native language, this tool simplifies the process by offering seamless translation between natural and programming languages.

Key Features
Code in Native Languages: Supports writing code in Hindi, Punjabi, and English, making it easier for non-English speakers to understand and participate in coding.

Multiple Programming Languages: The compiler is capable of translating the native language code into a variety of programming languages like Python, Java, C, and more.

Cross-Language Functionality: Write code in your native language and compile it into multiple programming languages without worrying about syntax barriers.

Ease of Use for Beginners: Ideal for beginners who find traditional programming languages difficult to grasp. It allows them to code in their own language and learn programming concepts in a familiar way.

Customization Options: Users can personalize the keywords and commands in the compiler, making it adaptable to their preferences or specific dialects of native languages.

Educational Tool: The compiler can also be used in classrooms to teach coding in a more intuitive and accessible manner, by leveraging local languages for instruction.

Use Cases
Education: Teaching programming to students who are more comfortable with native languages.
Multilingual Development: Allowing developers to collaborate using different languages without worrying about translation or language barriers.
Open Source Projects: Encouraging contributions from developers around the world who can code in their native languages.
How It Works
Write your code in any of the supported native languages or programming languages.
The compiler translates your code into the selected programming language (like Python, Java, etc.).
Execute the compiled code directly or modify it as needed in the desired language.
Supported Languages
Native Languages: Hindi, Punjabi, English (more languages coming soon)
Programming Languages: Python, Java, C (expandable to other languages)
Future Development
Expanding the list of supported native and programming languages.
Improving the translation accuracy for complex programming logic.
Adding IDE support for easier development and debugging.
